                        <strong class="question">As the CEO of SimpleX Internet, who is your ideal candidate for an employee?</strong>
                        <p class="summary">Someone with upright values who gives confidence and trust to other employees.</p>
                        <p>SimpleX Internet is leading the dynamic IT industry by investing boldly, developing new technologies and providing differentiated services.<br>
                        It was individuals who made this vision achievable – employees at SimpleX Internet who shared the values and paved the way for growth with their own ideas and values.</p>
                        <p>In saying this, SimpleX Internet is looking for dynamic individuals who can see into the future and become the forerunners of change. An individual who is creative and who can eventually shape the future with that same creativity, and an individual who is always willing to take on new challenges.</p>

                        <strong class="question">Why are “confidence” and “creativity” considered so important?</strong>
                        <p class="summary">A person that asks “WHY?” rather than just saying “YES”</p>
                        <p>Looking back on my life, I think I was more of a "why" person than a “yes” person. I majored in physics, and it wasn’t until I got a job as a CP (Contents Provider) that IT piqued my interest.</p>
                        <p>As luck would have it, it was a time when venture start-ups began to boom, and I implemented business ideas that had been on my mind for a while, and that eventually led to SimpleX Internet of today.<br>
                        I think this was possible because of the question, “why?” As you constantly work on something very straightforward and keep raising questions, you find yourself discovering new things. This is the reason why SimpleX Internet is looking for creative individuals who can think outside the box and not be hindered by existing ideas.</p>
                        <p>In addition, confidence is the most powerful means of improving competitiveness of a company. Confidence amongst employees leads to a confident organization.<br>
                        If an organization is confident, employees will voluntarily join in its effort to realizing the company’s vision, fueled by a sense of ownership. Such a mindset will serve as a great foundation for launching the company to success.</p>

                        <strong class="question">How are talents selected by SimpleX Internet different from others?</strong>
                        <p class="summary">Being "purpose-driven" and "unafraid of challenges" is the key</p>
                        <p>Today, many companies make decisions on a suitable candidates based on their education and language abilities.
                        At SimpleX Internet, a candidate with a clear “purpose” and who is not afraid of challenges would have an edge over other candidates who simply rely on their education and scores.<br>
                        This is why interviews take up the longest time. Interviews are conducted by each team leader, personnel department and the CEO. Only those who have shown their potential to grow together with the company and have shown to be purpose-driven and unafraid of challenges are currently working with us today.</p>
                        <p>Employees at SimpleX Internet keep their individuality amid the company culture that encourages “freedom based on confidence”, along with a flexible mindset that allow them to be open to new ideas. These are the characteristics that define those working at SimpleX Internet.</p>
