                    <p class="point"><strong>Practical management based on trust</strong><br>Customers base their satisfaction on how much they can trust a company. Our priority is to satisfy our customers through continuous investment on technology and infrastructure.</p>
                    <div class="mText">
                        <p>Trust among employees, between employees and the company, and between the company and customers is all that makes the difference for a business.</p>
                        <p>Building trust within an organization works as the foundation for improving competitiveness.</p>
                        <p>Hence, when trust is incorporated into a company's management philosophy and vision, it creates a synergy effect which eventually leads to the gaining of "customer trust".</p>
                        <p>"Korean Wave" has been one of the most significant cultural trends of the last decade and I believe now is the perfect opportunity for Korean companies to expand into the global market.</p>
                        <p>SimpleX Internet will strive to provide competitive global solutions through innovation and investment to help more customers step out into the global market.</p>
